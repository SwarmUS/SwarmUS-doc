# Hardware Home
The Hardware section will present the developed and used hardware by the SwarmUS team. 
The SwarmUS team has developed two PCB with their own name. To help with the nomenclature, 
here is the list of all the boards developed by the SwarmUS team :

1. The [HiveBoard](HiveBoard/HiveBoard_V1.000.md)
2. The [BeeBoard](BeeBoard/BeeBoard_V1.000.md)

Follow the link to learn more about each board specifically.

The designs for both these boards are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/SwarmUS/Electrical).
