# Hardware Home

The Hardware section presents the hardware that composes the SwarmUs platform:

1. The [HiveBoard](HiveBoard/HiveBoard_V1.000.md). This is the main embedded computer that, when plugged into a robot, enables it with swarm capacities.
2. The [BeeBoard](BeeBoard/BeeBoard_V1.000.md). These boards are Ultra-wideband (UWB) chip and antennas modules that allow the interlocalization to occur. There are meant to be plugged into a HiveBoard.

Follow the link to learn more about each board specifically.

The designs for both these boards are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/SwarmUS/Electrical).
