**HiveMindBridge** is a C++ library that provides an interface with the [HiveMind API](../HiveMind/hivemind-api.md). It wraps many API calls and manages the acknowledgement of messages. The library works in an asynchronous manner, meaning that it supports making blocking calls without halting the execution flow of the program. HiveMindBridge was designed to work in a [standalone manner](https://github.com/SwarmUS/HiveMindBridge/blob/master/examples/hello-world.cpp), but can easily be interfaced with a ROS environment, like in these examples ([1](https://github.com/SwarmUS/SwarmUS-ROS/blob/master/src/hive_mind_bridge/src/main.cpp)) ([2](https://github.com/SwarmUS/SwarmUS-ROS/blob/master/src/swarmus_turtlebot/src/main.cpp)).

The codebase for HiveMindBridge is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/SwarmUS/HiveMindBridge). The API documentation is hosted [here](https://swarmus.github.io/HiveMindBridge/classIHiveMindBridge.html).
