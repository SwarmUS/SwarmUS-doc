One of the main goal of the Android app is to visualize the state of the Swarm directly from the HiveAR app.

## Augmented Reality (AR): <a name="ar"></a>

Augmented Reality is a quick diagnostic tool that is used mostly to get the immediate state of visible agents.
At a close range, if the device is pointed towards the april tag on top of a specific agent, details of this agent will appear on top of it.<!--add reference or detail what this is--> 
Information contained in that view are:

- Last time agent was updated
- Status of the agent (User most define the comportement as it can differs from one agent to another)
- Last command sent from the Android device to the agent.

## Messages Logging: <a name="logs"></a>

Logs are a great way to know what information came from or to the Android device.
They can be found in the Connection tab.
They can help to see if a command came through, or what were the arguments of the incoming function call.

!!! Tip
    Logs can be shortened or detailed whenever needed with the "Detailed logs" checkbox.
