HiveAR is the Android application that makes the user interact with the swarm directly when a HiveBoard is connected to the Android device. 

The codebase for HiveAR is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/SwarmUS/HiveAR).

    - [Through augmented reality (AR)](hivear-visualization.md#ar)
    - [With runtime logs](hivear-visualization.md#logs)
- [Configure the swarm and its agents](hivear-configuration.md)
    - [HiveBoard network configuration](../Networking/configure-wifi.md) (From Networking reference section)
