The easiest way to configure the Wi-Fi network on HiveBoards is by using the [HiveAR](https://github.com/SwarmUS/HiveAR) Android application. Each HiveBoard will need to be configured individually, so the following procedure should be repeated for every board that you wish to connect to a same Wi-Fi network.

> Before you start, make sure you have the most recent version of the [HiveAR](https://github.com/SwarmUS/HiveAR) app. The installation files are generated by the continuous integration pipeline as artifacts. You can download an APK file by clicking on one of the [workflow runs](https://github.com/SwarmUS/HiveAR/actions) and then selecting the apk file.

## Connect the Android Device to the HiveBoard

To connect the HiveAR app running on an Android device to a HiveBoard, **you must first disconnect the Ethernet cable from the HiveBoard**. Then, plug the micro-USB cable from the HiveBoard to the Android Device as shown in the image below.

> **Why must the Ethernet cable be disconnected?**

> A HiveBoard can only be connected to one host at a time (be it a robot runnung [HiveMindBridge](https://github.com/SwarmUS/HiveMindBridge), usually connected vie Ethernet, or an Android device running HiveAR). If the HiveBoard and the robot's embedded computer already have a connection established, it will be impossible to establish a second connection to the Android device. Thus, we advise that you unplug the Ethernet cable prior to using HiveAR with a given HiveBoard.
