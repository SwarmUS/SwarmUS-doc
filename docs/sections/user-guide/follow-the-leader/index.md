# Follow the Leader Example

This section presents a more complete use-case implemented using the SwarmUS platform. In the Follow the Leader example, one of the agents in the swarm is designated as the "leader". As the leader moves in a 2D space, the other agents will try to maintain a constant relative position to the leader. Thus, the robots will effectively follow the leader.

This example has been fully implemented in these GitHub repos: [SwarmUS-ROS](https://github.com/SwarmUS/SwarmUS-ROS) and [HiveMind](https://github.com/SwarmUS) <!-- TODO faire pointer vers un tag-->
