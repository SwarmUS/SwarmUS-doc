# User Guides Home

The user guides provide step-by-step instructions to help users implement a swarm solution using SwarmUS. Complete newcomers will want to start with the [basic examples](basic-examples/led-flash-buzz.md), which show how to use the core features of the SwarmUS platform.

Once you have mastered the basics, head on to the more complete [Follow the leader example](follow-the-leader/index.md).

!!! tip
    Users looking for information on more precise topics will want to refer to the [Reference section](../reference/index.md) section.
