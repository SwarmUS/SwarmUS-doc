# User Guides Home

The user guides provide step-by-step instructions to help users implement a swarm solution using SwarmUS. Complete newcomers will want to start with the [basic examples](basic-examples/led-flash-buzz.md), which show how to use the core features of the SwarmUS platform.

Once you have mastered the basics, head on to the more complete [Follow the leader example](follow-the-leader/index.md).


<!-- To create a swarm using HiveBoards, start by defining you own use-case: what will your robots accomplish? How will they need to cooperate in order to acheive their goal?

When you have answered those questions, break down all the actions that each robot will need to perform individually and collectively. The individual actions will be implemented in each robot using [HiveMindBridge](hivemind-bridge-getting-started.md). These actions will then be called by the [Buzz scripts](buzz-scripts-getting-started.md) that will be executed within the HiveBoard. The Buzz scripts will implement the collective actions that the swarm will perform. -->
